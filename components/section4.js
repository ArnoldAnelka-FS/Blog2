<p>1. MongoDB-After creating your project in React, make sure you have installed MongoDB  to store the large scale of data that is received from the API you are planning to make calls from . 
3. Postman -Set up an account with Postman. This is a rest client that will allow us to run request codes and check our routes and make updates once its live.
